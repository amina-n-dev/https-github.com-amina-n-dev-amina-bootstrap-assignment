                Humans have been keeping honey bees for at least ten thousand years and our influences have selected for certain traits: honey production, gentleness, heartiness. There are many subspecies of honey bees which were separated by region, but because of importing it is difficult to find pure versions of these lineages. This is especially true in the Americas because we have no native honey bees; they were imported here from Europe in the 1600’s and are highly hybridized now.

                    FYI on Bees!
                    <small class="text-muted">Honey bees are super-important pollinators for flowers, fruits and                vegetables. This means that they help other plants grow! Bees transfer pollen                   the        male and female parts, allowing plants to grow seeds and fruit.

Lorem Ipsum   has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
